A robot car that uses an Arduino uno board as well as a L298N driver to control the Dc Motors

In this project, I used the wifi connection capability of the Arduino uno and was able to write script in HTML that allowed me to control the Robot car wirelessely through my phone. The html buttons returned a value and the actual movmement was 
then processed and initilized using c++ code. 

Here is a picture of the arduino
